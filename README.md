CLPadMapper
-----------

This is an improved and extended version of the CLPadMapper project located in the Node_Presentation repo. It has a slightly more stable crawler, filtering options, and more data parsed out of each request.

WARNING: I'm currently hacking on this code for my own fun so it's very likely to change and break from one day to the next.

TODO
-----------
1. Create image widget for the infowindow popup
2. Refactor sliders and mapper code - progress
3. Mark a pin in gray after it's been viewed -- done
4. Cookies to remeber filtering settings
